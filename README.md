# TFCV-Exp project
This website (<a href="https://tfcv-exp.narod.ru">tfcv-exp.narod.ru</a>) was created for the students of a course in Complex Analysis I taught at Lomonosov Moscow State University. 

As far as the coding is concerned, I meant to build the pages that look exactly the same in all browsers and screen resolutions â€“ at least, on desktop and laptop devices.
